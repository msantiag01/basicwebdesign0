            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello good humans! My name is Michelle Santiago and I am 20 years old.
                    I am currently a part-time college student in Tennessee. Traveling
                    is something I have always wanted to do growing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oaxaca, Mexico was actually the first place I went to when I got my passport. Traveling outside of the country for the first time was scary. Even though I had gone to different state and even adventured out west, I had never been far south before. However, once I was there I started getting the hang of things pretty fast and fell in love with traveling. It really opened my eyes on how big the world is and how even thousands of miles away from home, I still found comfort here. My goals for the future are to travel to other states of Mexico and countries and share my stories from traveling.
