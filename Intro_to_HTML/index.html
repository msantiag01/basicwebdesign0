    <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
    <p>Oaxaca is my home away from home. Oaxaca is located in the southwest region of Mexico and touches the Pacific Ocean. I traveled there last summer during the Guelaguetza Festival. 
    The Guelaguetza Festival is an annual event that takes place in late July to early August and celebrates Indigenous culture. This festival brings together different communities from across the state of Oaxaca. 
    However, you don't have to attend the festival to experience the richness of Oaxacan culture. Oaxaca is filled with ancient pyramids, temples, and historical cathedrals. There is always something new to learn and discover in Oaxaca.</p>
